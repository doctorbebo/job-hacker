This Portfolio builder is straightforward and simple. Upon request, input a github username at which point the app will generate
a pdf information page. The user may also choose a background color for the pdf file. The page includes their profile picture, name, username, and more. This is my first app built in node.js. 
all of the prgramming was accomplished in javaScript. I used several node packages to build the app file system, pdfKit, axios 
and inquirer. 

# how to use:
download the package and place all the files in one folder.
Open index.js and run       npm install
Next, simply run            npm index.js
Supply input upon request
Done! it should generate a pdf in the relative folder.
